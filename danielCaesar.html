    Ashton Dumar Norwill Simmonds(born April 5, 1995), known professionally as Daniel Caesar,
     is a Canadian singer and songwriter. After independently building a following through the 
     release of two critically acclaimed EPs, Praise Break (2014) and Pilgrim's Paradise (2015), 
     Caesar released his debut studio album, Freudian, in August 2017, which garnered widespread 
     critical acclaim.
